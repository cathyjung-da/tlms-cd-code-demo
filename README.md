# Contract Developer Code Demo Repository

Welcome to the **contract-dev-code-demo** repository! This repo serves as a central location for storing all the code demos used in the lessons written for the [Contract Developer certification program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-5tbm9YXFXJb-s4rUhyxdZkOrP5fuzhB90D0F7Q4E9I/edit#gid=1161341563). You can simply clone the repo and run the code to efficiently review the technical lessons. 

## Repository Structure
At the top level of the repository, you will find folders representing each [course](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QkXu5MC0fTR-8tJfQcgQWQvJcr-yjZLF) within the Contract Developer certification program. For example, the `01-advanced-fundamentals` folder corresponds to the "Advanced Fundamentals" course.

Within each course folder, you will find subfolders representing individual lessons within the course. For instance, the `01-functional-programming(1)` folder inside `01-advanced-fundamentals` corresponds to a specific lesson within the "Advanced Fundamentals" course.

The daml directory within each lesson folder contains the code demos used for specific slides within the lesson. For example, the file `CollectionDataTypes.daml` contains the code demo used for the "Collection Data Types" slide within the lesson. These code demos are designed to illustrate and clarify the main concepts covered in each lesson.

If you encounter errors in the code, please refer to the lesson slide and read the speaker's notes to confirm whether the error is intentional or not before making a pull request to fix it.

## Repository Updates
This repository is regularly updated whenever there are updates to the code demos used in the lessons. You can stay up to date by pulling the latest changes from the repository.
