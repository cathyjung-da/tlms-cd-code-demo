# Contract Developer Path - Directory Structure

At the top level of the directory, you will find folders representing each course within the Contract Developer certification program. For example, the `01-advanced-fundamentals` folder corresponds to the "Advanced Fundamentals" course.

Within each course folder, you will find subfolders representing individual lessons within the course. For instance, the `01-functional-programming(1)` folder inside `01-advanced-fundamentals` corresponds to a specific lesson within the "Advanced Fundamentals" course.

The daml directory within each lesson folder contains the code demos used for specific slides within the lesson. For example, the file `CollectionDataTypes.daml` contains the code demo used for the "Collection Data Types" slide within the lesson. These code demos are designed to illustrate and clarify the main concepts covered in each lesson.
